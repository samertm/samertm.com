I'm Samer Masterson, and you've stumbled upon my site. I am a software engineer at Sourcegraph in San Francisco, and an Emacs Lisp engineer in my free time. I enjoy talking about Emacs, productivity, organization, compilers, lisp, and music.

I was in the first Summer '14 batch of [Recurse Center](//recursecenter.com), where people go to do cool things. I made some stuff and had a blast!

I founded the George Mason University GNU/Linux User Group. Lots of good things happen there, check out the <a href="http://www.gmulug.com">website</a>.
