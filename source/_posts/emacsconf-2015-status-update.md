This will be a short update, because I'm feeling a bit spacey at the moment.

I'm organizing [EmacsConf 2015](http://emacsconf.org), and I would love it if you could make it. We've had almost 200 signups on our interest form (https://goo.gl/forms/tv0sDuApd8) so far, which I'm really happy about.

The idea is to build infrastructure for EmacsConf 2015 that we can use for future Emacs conferences too, and potentially leverage the EmacsConf event to turn [emacsconf.org](http://emacsconf.org) into a "social space" for Emacsers. I'll follow up with more details later.
