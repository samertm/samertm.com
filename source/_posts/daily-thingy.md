Short blog post, my brain is fried. I'll post additional thoughts another day.

I want to work on things that are:

1. well defined
2. interesting
3. orthogonal to my other projects

I need to learn more algorithms. I feel as if I have a gaping hole in my brain where my knowledge of algorithms should be. So I've decided to work on at least one algorithms problem from the Algorithm Design Manual by Steven Skiena. I've done well with my daily ritual, so I will incorporate this into the ritual by picking one problem in the morning that I will finish by the end of the day.

Must zzz for now, more details to follow.
