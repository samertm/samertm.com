Today was fun. Finally nailed down the design of the recursive descent parser with Aki's help. Aki told me that the usual way of determining which branch in the grammar to take was by finding the first string literal unique to the branch. That idea was the catalyst I needed in order to finish the design of my parser, and I got the parser to work with package clauses and import declarations.

I had been stuck in the design phase of the parser for the last three days, and it feels good to finally be unstuck! I can't wait to make more progress tomorrow.
