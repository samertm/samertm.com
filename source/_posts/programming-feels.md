A friend just sent me this via facebook chat, a feeling every programmer knows all too well:

    I can't code in Scheme
    god fucking damn.
    *describes code*
    HMMMM
    WAIT
    IT WORKS
    AHHHHH
    HAHAHA
    XDD
    Nyak nyak nyak
    I am a lisp god.
    lisssssssssp
    a lisp snake

Feel that rush of dopamine!
