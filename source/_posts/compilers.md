Title: hacker school plan (compilers!)

What needs to be done:

* pay for my first month of rent
* sell all my things
* do spanish duolingo stuff
* think about viva pinata
* do compilers stuff!

To flesh out my 'compilers' plan, I basically have all of May to finish the [stanford compilers](http://www.coursera.org/course/compilers) course! Here's my planned schedule:

* Already finished: all lectures through lexical analysis
* This week (4/27 - 5/3): finish lexical analysis & finite automata lectures and assignment 1
* Next week (5/4 - 5/10): finish parsing, top down parsing I & II lectures, assignment 2
* Week after (5/11 - 5/16): finish semantic analysis, cool type checking, runtime organization lectures, assignment 3
* Week after that (5/17 - 5/23): I have literally never planned this far in advance!

This is all prep for working on more compiler things at hacker school.
