Had a chill day today. Played Sim City 2000 a bunch. Five or something airplanes crashed and set my city on fire.

Was disappointed today when I found out that Viva Pinata doesn't work on Linux ): I just realized that all my favorite games simulate some aspect of real life, but with a fast-forward button so you can watch things grow. Someone should write a game where you manage a programmer's mood and motivation while they write a parser... it would be like the sims, but with only one sim that represented me.
