Stanford's [compilers course on coursera](http://www.coursera.org/course/compilers) is awesome, but they only distribute the cool tools with a vm (of bodhi linux, a distribution I have never used before). I couldn't find the tools anywhere online, so I freed the tools from their vm prison. It includes coolc, the cool compiler, and spim, a MIPS emulator.

Download the tools here: [cool.tar.gz](/res/cool.tar.gz)
