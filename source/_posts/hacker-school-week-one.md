I implemented a couple non-terminals today, and worked on a midi-generator with Mihai, which was a lot of fun. The project was in C++, and I forgot how much fun it is to write clever C(++, technically, but I don't normally write in C++) code! Clever things in any language make me giddy with excitement haha... Though I realize they have no place in production, they will always have a place in my heart. <3

I've had a fantastic time so far! I love the city, my batchmates, and the fact that I've actually gotten work done. I didn't used to think I could function in a self-directed environment, because of how badly I function in directed ones, but I've been really thriving here!

I have been kind of anxious about how large of a project the Go compiler is, though. I'm going to try to come in early tomorrow morning and try to knock out a lot of work before people show up. There's no harm in cutting down the scope of the project, but it's something I would rather not do.

Also, a friend show me this, (｢･ω･)｢, and I can't get over how adorable it is!!! (｢･ω･)｢ (｢･ω･)｢ (｢･ω･)｢
