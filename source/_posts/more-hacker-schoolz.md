This is more of a filler blog post before I get back to work. I didn't get as much done during the day as I wanted to (zero commits on github, broke my streak ;_;). Staying up late with Bert right now. We talked about programming languages and the differences between what appeal to us. Found out that we're both super into jangle pop (well, I'm super into jangle pop, and he's just getting started haha). Working on my parser, going to see how many statements I can stuff into it today. If I can parse the main today that would be cool... might be able to present it. Didn't do as much this week as I did last week, probably because the parser is a much larger project. It's much easier to slack when the thing I'm trying to accomplish is hard. Morrissey, give me strength.
