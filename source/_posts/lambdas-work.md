I GOT LAMBDAS TO WORK! It was a stupid problem in my def code for hooking up symbols to the environment. I assumed that every symbol evaluated to itself (because I finished it before I had functions), and so every function was simply returning its own memory address. That bug took so long to find, I should have figured it was a dumb one.
