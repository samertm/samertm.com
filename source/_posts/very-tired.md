>In the beginning, God created the earth, and he looked upon it in His cosmic loneliness.

>And God said, "Let Us make living creatures out of mud, so the mud can see what We have done." And God created every living creature that now moveth, and one was man. Mud as man alone could speak. God leaned close as mud as man sat up, looked around, and spoke. Man blinked. "What is the purpose of all this?" he asked politely.

>"Everything must have a purpose?" asked God.

>"Certainly," said man.

>"Then I leave it to you to think of one for all this," said God.

>And He went away.

Not all of my ideas are good. I thought it would be a good idea to stay up and write a comment engine for my blog because disqus is proprietary. Turns out that was a bad idea... super tired, and not very much progress was made. On the up side, I did have a lot of caffeine.

Funny that my worst blog post comes right after the "write excellent blog posts" talk :) That's just how it happened. Or, as Bokonon would say, that's how it was meant to happen.
