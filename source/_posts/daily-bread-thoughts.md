I had a great blog post half-finished when my ssh connection died (and Emacs didn't save a back up--the one time I needed the feature it didn't come through -_-), so ya'll get a condensed version: things that I do without thought can fit into my life without burdening me, and I always make time for them, no matter how busy I am. So, I should fashion the things that I want to do but don't have time for into daily, mindless, zero-decisions-needed activities.

I'm going to start with my social Emacs site idea. I haven't been able to start writing code, so I'm setting my sights lower: every day, I will do five minutes of planning and thinking for the idea, and I will write my notes down.

I started today, and I have some notes that I'd like to share. I'm going to start posting them to my blog after connecting it to the Recurse Center feed and planet emacsen, and after setting up a commenting thing, so I can gather feedback on my notes.
