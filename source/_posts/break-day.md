Hey, another filler blog post. Gotta keep up my streak! I did the jobs challenge today in go. We had to build a phonebook command line applications, and I wrote mine in Go. I thought the task would be super easy, but it uncovered some deficits in my knowledge of Go, specifically when it came to writing and reading from files. I had more trouble with that than I'm comfortable to admit :) But it was a nice change of pace to work on a short, well-contained task. Also got groceries and had like five glasses of soy milk, I swear to god they actually put crack in it.
