I've been super unproductive recently, and I've been gathering advice for how to consistently do work. The overwhelming response has been to make abstract goals more concrete. I gave the idea a test drive today by breaking my goal of actually starting on the semantic analysis phase into discrete steps, with a time estimate for the task as well. When I start something, I write it on a sticky note and stick it onto my laptop. It worked surprisingly well today; I was able to make significant progress, and I have a vision for how I want to complete the semantic analysis and IR generation phases. Woo.
