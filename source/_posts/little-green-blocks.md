The only streak I've been able to keep up during my time at Hacker School is my blogging one: I've written a blog post for every day I've been here. Even though I've written a lot of trash posts (like this one!), I've become more comfortable with writing, and some of the discussions that have spurred from my posts have been a lot of fun.

I haven't been conscious of my github commits, though. As a consequence of the work I've done at Hacker School, I've committed something almost every day, but I have missed a couple days. I'm going to commit (heh) myself to committing a non-trivial change to a public project on my github every single day, similar to John Resig's [experiment](http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/).
