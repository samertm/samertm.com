I recently signed up for a microinstance with DigitalOcean for five dollars a month. DigitalOcean has a fantastic interface for creating &quot;droplets&quot;, or instances, especially compared to Amazon's AWS. The server is running Debian right now. Compared to my experiences with Arch, setting up Nginx and Postfix/Dovecot was a breeze.
