Title: emacs

Project emacs is underway right now. I got Richard Stallman's autograph on my emacs manual. Richard Stallman doesn't walk, he floats into a room. He doesn't have an especially commanding presence, but the whole room focused on him anyways. He makes lots of puns. Someone introduced himself, &quot;My name is Hashem&quot;, and Stallman replied, &quot;Yes, I do sometimes.&quot; What a character.

I decided to start learning Emacs because I wasn't satisfied with how Vim handled multiple buffers. It's absolutely simple to work with multiple text files in Emacs, and I've fallen in love with the power of Emac's lisp interpreter as well.

My .emacs file and .emacs.d folder are both works-in-progress, but if you're curious you can take a look at them <a href="http://www.github.com/samertm/dotfiles">here</a>.
