Title: schedule generator

I built a <a href="/schedule">schedule generator</a> to make it easier to find time for the things I want to get done.

The site uses the Meteor.js framework. This was my first time using Javascript to build an application, and I enjoy writing in it. The fact that callbacks and anonymous functions are so easy to create makes the language feel powerful. Grab the code <a href="https://github.com/samertm/schedule_generator">here</a>.
