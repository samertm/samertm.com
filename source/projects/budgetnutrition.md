Mark McCaskey, Erik Kniaz, Edward Lane and I built [budgetnutrition.org](http://budgetnutrition.org) at bitcamp 2014, University of Maryland's hackathon. The problem was reasonably challenging, and it was a lot of fun to work on. It's also exciting because I've never had a half-way monetizable idea before, and I plan on expanding [budgetnutrition.org](http://budgetnutrition.org) until it's good enough to actually use. The server is written in go, and we parse data from Wolfram's api in python 3.
