I wrote a tiny website so I can note what I want to get done, and it'll remind me later. It uses non-expiring cookies so that I'll remember to work on \<blank\> even if I close my browser! It's a neat little thing, and I've set it to my homepage. The next step is to get reddit, hacker news et al. to redirect to it.

The code isn't super well organized, partially because the scope of this project was so tiny. But this did incentivize me to pull the web code I use for forms and sessions into its own library, humbly named [samerhttp](https://github.com/samertm/samerhttp).
