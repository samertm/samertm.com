Title: desk

I built a desk with my little brother &amp; a friend. It's pretty nifty. I think I made the legs a bit too long, so I have to saw them off or sand them down.

The biggest lesson I learned was that, when you're working with wood, it's always going to be more expensive than you think! I did not expect to spend that much on the desk, but the final result was absolutely worth it.
